# Neural Style Transfer 

Neural Style Transfer is the use of AI (neural networks) to learn the Style from one image 
and use that knowledge to modify the content image.

I am using the VGG-19 model, which has already been trained on the imagenet dataset. 
we pass our style image through the model and retrieve the processed image at certain layers 

I am using the eager implementation of the keras library.

# Dependencies 

1. numpy
2. keras 
3. tensorflow
